# üåç Exploring Global Population Trends: A Data-Driven Approach

## üìå Overview  
This project explores global population trends using data analysis and visualization techniques. The goal is to uncover insights into demographic distribution, historical growth patterns, and the relationship between population and economic factors.  

## üìä Key Questions Explored  

### **Part 1 - Understanding the Current State of Global Population**  
- What is the current global population?  
- Which countries have the highest and lowest populations?  
- Do these countries also have high population densities?  

### **Part 2 - Trends in Global Population Growth: A Historical Overview**  
- How has global population changed every decade from 1960?  
- How is the population growth across continents?  
- Which countries have experienced the fastest population growth rates?  
- How does income level influence population growth rates?  

### **Part 3 - Demographic Composition: Age, Gender, and Urbanization Patterns**  
- How does the age structure vary across different regions?  
- Which countries have the most balanced gender ratios?  
- What is the distribution of urban vs. rural populations globally?  

### **Part 4 - The Impact of Population Growth on Economic Development**  
- How does population correlate with GDP?
