## üåç Exploring Global Population Trends: A Data-Driven Approach  

### üìå Overview  
This project analyzes global population trends using data exploration and visualization techniques. It examines demographic distribution, historical growth patterns, and the relationship between population and economic factors.

### üìä Key Questions Explored  

#### **Part 1 - Understanding the Current Global Population**  
- What is the current global population?  
- Which countries have the highest and lowest populations?  
- Do these countries also have high population densities?  

#### **Part 2 - Trends in Global Population Growth**  
- How has the global population changed every decade since 1960?  
- How has population growth varied across continents?  
- Which countries have experienced the fastest and slowest population growth rates?  
- How does income level influence population growth rates?  

#### **Part 3 - Demographic Composition: Age, Gender, and Urbanization**  
- How does the age distribution vary across regions?  
- Which countries have the most balanced gender ratios?  
- What is the global distribution of urban vs. rural populations?  

#### **Part 4 - The Impact of Population Growth on Economic Development**  
- How does population size correlate with GDP?
